# Byle

Byle (Danish "City" + le) is a total rip-off of the [Worldle](https://github.com/teuteuf/worldle) and [Contryle](https://countryle.com) concept. Instead of countries this version allows the user to guess one of the 151 Danish cities with a population of more than 5000. You can guess a new city every day.

You can try Byle [here](https://byle.askefc.net).
